# Move the BD out

This talk comes after my first experience with production code. I have dwelt before on the use of functional programming languages. But just finished my work on a clojure web application (relatively simple). As part of it, I have realized that there are things that need to improve regarding how I develop the code. Through two main samples, I will show how I think I have approached the code in a procedural way, instead of thinking more of how it would have been on a pure functional approach. I don't have good answers yet, just a few questions and points to improve my code.
